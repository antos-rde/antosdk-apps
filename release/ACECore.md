# ACECore
This package is AntOS wrapper of the wellknown Ace editor.

Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. The goal is to create a browser based 
editor that matches and extends the features, usability and performance of existing native 
editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. It can be easily embedded in any web page or 
JavaScript application. Ace is developed as the primary editor for 
[Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/) and the successor of the Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project.
